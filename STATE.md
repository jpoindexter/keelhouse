# STATE — agent cli (handoff 2026-07-08 17:40)

Mirror of `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/ops/handoffs/handoff-2026-07-08-1519-agent-cli-folder-picker.md`. Overwrite on each handoff.

## Goal

Build **agent cli** — a native macOS Tauri 2 app that replaces Jason's VS Code workflow (file-explorer rail + CodeMirror editor + real `claude`/`codex` CLI terminal panes), built on Ghostty's terminal engine. Current work: starting v0.5 file rail/editor shell work.

## Done

- **SPIKE-2 (proven):** full terminal loop in a real Tauri window — pty → `libghostty-vt` (real Ghostty VT parsing, in Rust) → grid snapshot over Tauri IPC → Canvas 2D paint; keydown → Ghostty key `Encoder` → pty. Verified by hand: shell renders, typing/arrows/ctrl-c work, `claude`'s fullscreen TUI renders clean.
- **Shortcuts (proven):** real key encoder (arrows, ctrl, Option-as-Meta word-nav, Fn, Shift+Enter, re-encodes on cursor/kitty mode change); Cmd+V paste (clipboard plugin, bracketed-aware); mouse drag selection + highlight; Cmd+C copy from selection; Cmd+K clear (native menu item).
- **Deep research → docs + planning:** `docs/vision-to-reality-2026-07-08.html` (6 areas, 24/25 claims verified). Library choices locked in PRD/ROADMAP/DECISIONS (2026-07-08 entries).
- **v0 folder-picker slice (VERIFIED 2026-07-08):** restructured pty from spawn-in-`setup()` to on-demand `open_workspace(path)` (spawns `$SHELL` in chosen cwd, tears down + respawns previous pane via `ChildKiller`). Added native folder picker (`plugin-dialog`), last-folder persistence (`plugin-store`, `workspace.json`), and a **Terminal → Open Folder… (Cmd+O)** menu item. Verified by hand with first launch, Cmd+O folder switch, and quit/relaunch persistence; `pwd` in the pane matched the selected folder each time.
- **AGENT-LAUNCH (VERIFIED 2026-07-08):** `open_workspace` now accepts a persisted launch profile. Default profile is `claude` via a login shell so nvm-installed CLIs resolve; backend only executes the supplied profile. Verified by hand: app launched `claude` as the direct child of `spike-2`, cwd was `/Users/jasonpoindexter/Documents/GitHub/apps/agent cli`, and Claude's fullscreen TUI rendered in the window.
- **TERMINAL-HARDEN (VERIFIED 2026-07-08):** snapshots now render Ghostty's visible viewport instead of only the active screen; Shift+PageUp/PageDown and mouse wheel scroll through Ghostty scrollback; key/paste snaps back to live output; resize dimensions are clamped before reaching the pty. Verified with a 300-line fast-output burst, Shift+PageUp/Down scrollback screenshots, resize smoke, and copy-selection audit.
- **APPROOT (VERIFIED 2026-07-08):** promoted `spike-2/` to `app/`; renamed npm package to `agent-cli`, Rust package to `agent-cli`, lib crate to `agent_cli_lib`, product/window title to `agent cli`, and identifier to `com.jasonpoindexter.agent-cli`. Verified from `app/`: `cargo test` (6 tests), `cargo build`, `npm run build`, `npm test`, and `npm run tauri dev`. Runtime smoke launched `target/debug/agent-cli`, spawned direct child `claude`, and `lsof` showed the child cwd was `/Users/jasonpoindexter/Documents/GitHub/apps/agent cli`.
- **PROCESS-ENV (VERIFIED 2026-07-08):** `open_workspace` now validates workspace cwd before spawn, preflights the selected launch command through the same login-shell mode used for launch, returns visible frontend errors instead of silently failing, and emits a pane-exit banner when a launched process exits. Verified with Rust tests (10 total), `npm run build`, `npm test`, `cargo build`, real bad-command launch (visible missing-command banner, no child process under `agent-cli`), real immediate-exit launch (`false`, child exited and no child remained), and real Claude launch regression (`claude` direct child cwd matched repo).
- **DATA-STORAGE (VERIFIED 2026-07-08):** `docs/local-state.md` documents the v0/v0.5 Tauri Store path (`~/Library/Application Support/com.jasonpoindexter.agent-cli/workspace.json`), current schema, reversible reset command, and default `launchProfile` repair path. `roadmap.html` rebuilt from `roadmap.json`.

## In progress

**Next active slice: APP-SHELL.** v0 terminal/process foundation is verified. Start v0.5 by building the stable three-part shell: file rail area, editor area, and terminal pane area, without implementing the full rail/editor behavior yet.

## Next (ordered)

1. **APP-SHELL:** stable three-part layout: file rail, editor area, terminal pane area.
2. **FILE-RAIL:** dense project file explorer. Stack per `ROADMAP.md`: `ignore` + `notify`+`notify-debouncer-mini` + React Arborist.
3. **EDITOR:** CodeMirror editor via `@uiw/react-codemirror`.

## Gotchas

- **Zig pinned to 0.15.2.** Every build/run MUST prefix PATH: `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/zig@0.15/bin:$PATH"`. Homebrew's default zig 0.16 breaks `libghostty-vt-sys`. Build: `cd app/src-tauri && PATH=... cargo build`. Run: `cd app && PATH=... npm run tauri dev`.
- **`libghostty-vt` types are `!Send`/`!Sync`.** Per pane, the `Terminal` + key `Encoder` are created inside and never leave ONE "terminal thread". A reader thread forwards pty bytes over an `mpsc` channel; only the `Send` pieces (channel `tx`, pty writer, `ChildKiller`) cross threads. Do NOT move `Terminal`/`Encoder` across threads — it won't compile and isn't safe.
- **Data flow:** pty bytes → `Terminal::vt_write` → `snapshot()` (full grid, cells w/ fg/bg/bold) → Tauri event `"grid"` → Canvas 2D. Input: JS `send_key`/`paste`/`resize_pty` commands → current pane's channel → terminal thread encodes + writes. Full-grid snapshots per frame (rAF-coalesced, not dirty-diffed yet — fine until fast output stutters).
- **Key files:**
  - `app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — backend: `spawn_pane()`, `open_workspace()`, `handle_key()`, `handle_paste()`, `snapshot()`, `key_from_code()`, `PtyState{pane: Mutex<Option<Pane>>}`, menu, tests.
  - `app/src/App.tsx` — canvas render loop, input encoding, workspace init (`initWorkspace`/`pickFolder`), selection wiring.
  - `app/src/selection.ts` — mouse selection math (`pointFromMouse`, `isCellSelected`, `selectionToText`).
  - `spike-ghostty-vt/` — original parsing-only spike + Zig-pin notes.
- **Planning = source of truth (read before deciding anything):** `PRD.md`, `ROADMAP.md` (has "Execution discipline" + per-phase stack), `DECISIONS.md` (append-only, don't edit past entries), `docs/vision-to-reality-2026-07-08.html`.
- **Execution discipline (locked in ROADMAP):** one thin vertical slice at a time; app runnable at every commit; measure-don't-preempt (no WebGL/SQL/worktrees/theming until measured need); the coding agent drives `lib.rs`/`App.tsx` (Jason reviews, doesn't hand-edit in parallel).
- **Stack:** Tauri 2 + React/TS/Vite + Rust; `libghostty-vt` 0.2.0; `portable-pty` 0.9; plugins: opener, clipboard-manager, dialog, store. Capabilities in `app/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`.

## Continuation prompt (for Codex)

Continue agent cli: read `STATE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` at the repo root, then resume at "Next" step 1 — APP-SHELL. v0 is verified: folder picker, last-workspace persistence, default `claude` agent launch, terminal hardening, APPROOT, PROCESS-ENV, and DATA-STORAGE. All builds/runs need `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/zig@0.15/bin:$PATH"` (zig 0.15.2 pin). Respect the Execution discipline in ROADMAP: one slice at a time, app runnable every commit, measure-don't-preempt.
